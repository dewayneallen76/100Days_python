# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# Iterating through numbers 1-20
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# When the number is equal to 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# That it is an integer between the values of 1 and 20
